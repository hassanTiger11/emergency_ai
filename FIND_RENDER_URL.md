# How to Find Your Render App URL

## The Issue
You entered your **database URL** instead of your **app URL**:
- ❌ **Database URL**: `postgresql://mubeen_account_db_user:...` (This is for connecting to the database)
- ✅ **App URL**: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com` (This is your web application URL)

## How to Find Your Render App URL

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard
1. Visit [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Log in to your account
3. Go to your Dashboard

### Step 2: Find Your Web Service
1. Look for your **Web Service** (not the database)
2. It should be named something like:
   - `emergency-ai`
   - `emergency-ai-backend`
   - `your-app-name`

### Step 3: Get the URL
1. Click on your **Web Service**
2. Look for the **"URL"** section
3. Copy the URL (it should look like):
   - `https://emergency-ai-xxxx.onrender.com`
   - `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

### Step 4: Test the URL
1. Open the URL in your browser
2. You should see your application (or a login page if auth is enabled)
3. If you see a 404 or error, your app might still be building

## Quick Test
Once you have the correct URL, run:
```bash
python test_render_correct.py
```

## Common Issues
- **App still building**: Wait a few minutes and try again
- **404 error**: Check if the URL is correct
- **Database connection error**: Make sure your app is deployed with the correct database URL

## Your Database URL (for reference)
Your database URL is: `postgresql://mubeen_account_db_user:AZwPKaC5wftLNqOZQcOsIgywI7WhUhT@dpg-d3jbj8a4d50c73f30pkg-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/mubeen_account_db`

This should be set as your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your Render app settings.
