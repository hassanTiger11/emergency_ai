# Upload Audio Fix - Summary

## Problem
The `upload_audio` endpoint was failing with the error:
```
'Depends' object has no attribute 'id'
'Depends' object has no attribute 'rollback'
```

## Root Cause
FastAPI's `Depends()` objects are only resolved when **FastAPI directly handles the route**. The issue was:

1. `routes.py` had `upload_audio()` with `Depends()` in the function signature
2. `api.py` was calling `upload_audio()` **manually** without passing the dependencies
3. The unresolved `Depends` objects were being used as if they were actual objects

## Solution (Option 1 - Implemented)

### Architecture Pattern
- **`api.py`** = HTTP Layer (handles FastAPI routes, dependency injection)
- **`routes.py`** = Business Logic (pure Python functions, testable without FastAPI)

### Changes Made

#### 1. `endpoints/routes.py` (Lines 32-37)
**Before:**
```python
async def upload_audio(
    session_id: str = Form(...),
    audio_file: UploadFile = File(...),
    current_user: Optional[Paramedic] = Depends(get_optional_current_user),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
```

**After:**
```python
async def upload_audio(
    session_id: str,
    audio_file: UploadFile,
    current_user: Optional[Paramedic] = None,
    db: Optional[Session] = None
):
```

**Changes:**
- Removed `Form(...)`, `File(...)`, and `Depends()` - these are FastAPI-specific
- Made function accept plain Python types
- Default values are `None` for optional parameters
- Function is now testable without FastAPI

#### 2. `api.py` (Lines 24-27, 77-94)
**Before:**
```python
# Conditional imports
if ENABLE_AUTH:
    from database.models import Paramedic
    from database.auth import get_optional_current_user
    from database.connection import get_db

@app.post("/api/upload-audio")
async def post_upload_audio(
    session_id: str = Form(...),
    audio_file: UploadFile = File(...)
):
    return await upload_audio(session_id=session_id, audio_file=audio_file)
```

**After:**
```python
# Always import (safe to use, dependencies handle auth internally)
from database.models import Paramedic
from database.auth import get_optional_current_user
from database.connection import get_db

@app.post("/api/upload-audio")
async def post_upload_audio(
    session_id: str = Form(...),
    audio_file: UploadFile = File(...),
    current_user: Optional[Paramedic] = Depends(get_optional_current_user),
    db: Optional[Session] = Depends(get_db)
):
    return await upload_audio(
        session_id=session_id,
        audio_file=audio_file,
        current_user=current_user,  # ✅ Now passing resolved dependencies
        db=db
    )
```

**Changes:**
- Moved imports out of conditional block (always available)
- Added `Depends()` to the route handler
- Pass resolved dependencies to the business logic function

## Benefits

### ✅ Fixed the Bug
- No more `'Depends' object has no attribute` errors
- Dependencies are properly injected by FastAPI

### ✅ Better Architecture
- Clear separation: HTTP layer vs business logic
- Business logic is framework-agnostic
- Follows Single Responsibility Principle

### ✅ Easier Testing
Can now test business logic without FastAPI:
```python
# Pure Python test - no FastAPI TestClient needed!
async def test_upload_processing():
    user = create_test_user()
    db = create_test_db_session()
    result = await upload_audio(
        session_id="test123",
        audio_file=mock_file,
        current_user=user,
        db=db
    )
    assert result["status"] == "completed"
```

### ✅ Reusability
The `upload_audio()` function can now be:
- Called from CLI scripts
- Used in background jobs
- Reused in other contexts
- Mocked/stubbed easily

## Testing

### Verified ✅
- Module imports work without errors
- No more `Depends` object errors
- Dependencies properly injected
- Route handler works correctly

### Next Steps for Full Testing
1. **Local test with real audio:**
   - Start the server: `uvicorn api:app --reload`
   - Login to the app
   - Record a voice note
   - Check that conversation appears in left pane

2. **Database verification:**
   - Run: `python tes_account_data.py`
   - Should show conversations saved

3. **Deploy to Render:**
   - Commit and push changes
   - Verify on production

## Files Modified
- ✅ `endpoints/routes.py` - Business logic layer
- ✅ `api.py` - HTTP/FastAPI layer
- ✅ Verified with test script (passed)

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Linter checks passed
- [x] Import test passed
- [x] Basic functionality test passed
- [ ] Manual test with real audio (recommended before deploy)
