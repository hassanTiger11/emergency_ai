I'm very tired, my chest hurts a lot. How long have you had this condition? Almost two weeks. Did you take any medicine? I took anti-inflammatory drugs, I took cough medicine. I have a smoker, I use it every day, I don't know what to do. Do you have a medical history, a crisis, a fever? Yes, I have a crisis and I took a cough medicine. I need to take antibiotics to reduce the temperature. Your temperature is 126.7 degrees, the fever is 36. I hope you are doing well, I just need to give you a smoker, and you need to see a doctor.
